### Installation of Appium and Robot Framework

The installation of Appium and Robot Framework can be done using the terminal of macOS.  

***Pre-requisites***  
To install Appium and RobotFramework, following packages should be installed :  
```
Homebrew                 #https://brew.sh/
Node.js
Java Development Kit
Phyton 3  
Xcode
Android Studio

Mac comes with pre-installed Python. The common problem is with some of the broken packages.  
Better to install newer version of Python apart from the one which is pre-installed.
```

If you don’t have Xcode and Android Studio installed yet, install them. Xcode can be downloaded in the App Store of macOS.  
Android Studio can be downloaded on the Android Developer website.

```
Xcode is an expensive resource and consumes around 18-20 GB once installed so remember to have good space in the hard disk. 
```

**install robotframework using the terminal**  
```
pip install robotframework
```

**install appium library for robotframework using the terminal**  
```
pip install robotframework-appiumlibrary
```

**install homebrew using the terminal**  
```
ruby -e “$(curl –fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

**install node and appium using the terminal**  
```
brew install node                                             # get node.js
sudo npm install -g appium --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root    # get appium
sudo npm install wd                                           # get appium client
```

**start and check status for appium server using the terminal**  
```
appium &                        # start appium
netstat -an | grep 4723         # check server status
```

**set path for Xcodebuild using the terminal**  
```
sudo xcode-select –s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/
```

**install tools to help appium using the terminal**  
```
cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/
open .
Right click Folder “node_modules” to click “Get info”
```

**setting up the appium-xcuitest-driver using the terminal**  
some of the external dependencies are required for appium to work  
```
brew install ideviceinstaller
brew install carthage or brew reinstall carthage
npm install -g ios-deploy
npm install -g deviceconsole
sudo gem install xcpretty
brew install libimobiledevice –-HEAD
sudo npm install appium-doctor -g
sudo npm install appium-webdriveragent
```  

All the above commands should get installed without errors. If there are errors, try executing with sudo.  
After installing the tools, one must set the home path for Java and Android. The path must be set to the file ***.bash_profile***

**run the below command to check if all the necessary appium dependencies are installed properly**
```
appium-doctor
```  

If all settings are correct, one can continue. If something is not set correctly, fix the issues first.

Once the Appium is configured correctly, it is time to set up the certificates for Apple in Xcode. This is needed to install the XCTest runner on iOS devices, which is needed to trigger the test cases on the device.  

**setting the WebDriverAgent**  
```
cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/appium/node_modules/appium-webdriveragent
./Scripts/bootstrap.sh -d
open -a Xcode WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj
```

**set Xcode for building iPhone (set iPhone to run automated test via Appium)**  

Navigate to Xcode and open the target WebDriverAgentLib and sign this with your Developer Account. Do the same for WebDriverAgentRunner. Build the project to validate if the signing was successful.

***WebDriverAgentLib***  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50976445/87915241-73889680-caa4-11ea-8d4f-6c81c11df084.png)  

***WebDriverAgentRunner***  

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50976445/87915461-ceba8900-caa4-11ea-95a1-f4c6ec7c16a0.png)  

There might be an error in Provisioning Profile & Signing Certificate.  
***hack to resolve the error***    
```
click on Build Settings
change the Product Bundle Identifier from it’s default to any other name
go back to General, the errors in the previous step should now be resolved
```

**With all the steps completed, build on any of the WebDriverAgentRunner, then the app should open in the simulator**

**quick checks to see if the device is ready for testing**  
```
netstat -an | grep 4723     #check if the appium server is up and running
appium-doctor               #check if all dependencies of appium are working fine
```

***good to go for appium robotframework automated tests***


# appium-robotframework
 appium-robotframework integration to test ios and andriod apps
 
 ***ios test scenario :***  
 ```
